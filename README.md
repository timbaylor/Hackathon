# Baylor-Hackathon-2023

# Won 2nd place in our division.

Annual 14 hour hackathon where participants focus on coding, including research, making a PowerPoint, giving a presentation explaining what technologies each used and how it fits into one of the prompts and showing a prototype to the judges.

This yearâ€™s Hackathon themes focused on sustainability, public safety and disaster relief. The goal of the project was to educate a young audience on the importance of sustainable energy economic developments. The judging criteria is broken into five categories: impact, innovation and creativity, sustainability, design and completeness of solution.

# We targeted the concept of water usage and water sustainability.

Utilizing the Python GUI toolkit, tkinter, we developed a potential mobile app with a large variety of dynamic features. Some of these features include adding personal independent profiles dependent on an indvidudal's water usage (spread over activities such as minutes spent in shower daily, showers per week, dishwasher loads per week). Depending on the indvidudal's amount of water used, the app will also provide a quick tip on futher water conservation practices. The user is then able to create multiple profiles and compare each profile's water useage across the board through both direct and graphical comparison.

Lastly, the app provides an integrated game (inspired by 2013 global phenomenon "Flappy Bird") as a fun alternative to futher educated and appeal epsically to a youth audience.
