# Baylor-Hackathon-2023

# Won 2nd place in our division at the Baylor Hackathon 2023
Annual 14 hour hackathon that includes coding, intensive research, building a slide deck, and lastly giving a presentation demonstrating the team's MVP & demo to the judges.

# Themes & Criteria
This yearâ€™s Hackathon themes focused on sustainability, public safety and disaster relief. 

The judging criteria is broken into five categories: impact, innovation and creativity, sustainability, design and completeness of solution.

The goal of the project was to educate a young audience on the importance of sustainable energy economic developments.

# We focused on water usage and water sustainability.
Utilizing the Python GUI toolkit, tkinter, we developed a potential mobile app with a large variety of dynamic features.

Some of these features include adding personal independent profiles dependent on an indvidudal's water usage (spread over activities such as minutes spent in shower daily, showers per week, dishwasher loads per week).

Depending on the indvidudal's amount of water used, the app will also provide a quick tip on futher water conservation practices.

The user is then able to create multiple profiles and compare each profile's water useage across the board through both direct and graphical comparison.

Lastly, the app provides an integrated game (inspired by 2013 global phenomenon "Flappy Bird") as a fun alternative to futher educated and appeal epsically to a youth audience.
